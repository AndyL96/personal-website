        <p class="intro">
            I graduated as a physiotherapist in 2019 at McGill University and have been working since then. 
            </br> However, in 2022, I discovered a passion for software development and decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
            </br> I was initially scared to change fields completely, but now I'm excited and looking forward to this new journey.

                <div class="title">Immediately after graduating from my bachelor, I started my Master of Science in Physical Therapy in May of 2018 and graduated in December of 2019.
                    My thesis was based on an integrated knowledge translation approach where three other students and I had to <u>develop and assess the usability of protocols for stroke guidelines in clinical practice.</u>

                <div class="title">After graduating, I had my first job as a physiotherapist at Action Sport Physio, one of Quebec's largest network of physiotherapy clinics.
                    However, when the pandemic began, a friend of mine offered me the opportunity to work at a smaller clinic closer to my place.
                    Since then, I have been practicing as a physiotherapist at Physiotherapie Mieux Etre.

                <div class="title">Between 2019-2022, I questioned myself if physical therapy was a career that I would want to do for the rest of my life. I started to lose the passion that I had 
                    at the beginning of my practice. That's when I discovered programming through my friends in SOEN. 
                </br>
                So, I decided to take a risk and go back to school to pursue another career. I completed a BCompSc. from 2022 to 2024 at Concordia University.
                I worked part-time as a physiotherapist to support myself.

                <div class="title">Since I graduated and after losing two members of my family, I decided to travel for a bit while still working part-time as a physiotherapist. 
                    In my spare-time, I would practice and perfect my programming skills.
